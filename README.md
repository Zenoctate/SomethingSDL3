# Building

Required `cmake` only  
_(Installing it should also install `make` and `gcc` automatically)_

``` bash
sh ./setup.sh               # Download SDL and SDL_image source code
cmake -S . -B build/
cmake --build build/        # OR just run make in build/ directory
```

The game is compiled in `./build/simple_sdl`, run this.

# Game Idea

Player shoots bullets to opponents
